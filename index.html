            <p>Hello there, I hope all is well, my name is Caesar Cooper and I am a current student in the Year Up program. Year Up is an amazing program that prepares students for the professional world and closes the opportunity divide. Not only does Year Up set you up with the knowledge to navigate one of many work-related fields, but it also gives you the tools to maintain professionalism as you climb your ladder of success. I am currently pursuing the application development track. This track teaches you how to code in many languages, including Java and JavaScript, then applies that to developing API and full-stack applications. So far, I have learned the fundamentals of backend development and have used this newfound knowledge to build functional code. Before Year Up, I worked a dead-end nine-to-five job that was stagnant and did not allow me to live up to my true potential. After Year Up, I plan to apply the skills I’ve obtained to a productive yet satisfying profession while proving myself as an invaluable asset. If you require a motivated and energetic developer to improve your software, I would be more than ecstatic to exchange LinkedIn information with you and talk about mutualistic opportunities. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to reaching out to you.</p>

                <p>My calling in life is technology. Ever since I was younger, I was interested in the way things works, specifically the mechanics behind advanced computer programs. I was fond of robotics and anything technologically advanced. I was amazed and fell in love instantly with everything electronic.</p>
                <p>I am also an extrovert. I love human interaction and working in a team environment. I believe communication is the key to cohesiveness and efficiency. I also flourish in a fast paced environment, I actually prefer it. Face paced environments keep my skills sharp and force me to prioritize and execute.</p>
